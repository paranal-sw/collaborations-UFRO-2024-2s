    "The observations at Paranal can end in three stages: STOP, ABORT by USER, ERROR (Aborted by system). Naive-Bayes models captures some of those events that leads to errors. In https://github.com/paranal-sw/parlogs-observations/blob/main/notebooks/04-naive-bayes.ipynb a simple Naive Bayes classificator is shown that predicts the df_meta[\"ERROR\"] column based on some simple tokenizations. \n",

    "3. Search and apply some Sentiment Analysis models, label the traces with \"SA_1\", \"SA_2\"... ([hint](https://huggingface.co/blog/sentiment-analysis-python))\n",
